# toolkit
Simple Modular Code Framework for Python

What is this?
It's for running different code in the same directory, but using only ONE code.
I made this just for fun, to practice my OOP stuff.

How does it work?
Assume the below directory:

Toolkit
|
- Toolkit.py
- test.py
- testone.py

Just simply run Toolkit.py, and type in "test" to run the "test.py" file.

## Features:
- Time elapsed
- Search tool
- Intelligent Command-Line Interface
- Simple and Easy to use
